Hi,

My Name Is Muzamil Bhat.In this repo i have tried to build some supervised Machine Models on some of the most popular Data-Sets and Have tuned the Parameters to get some unexpected results 
please go through these models and i have also tried to visualise the data with the help of seaborn and matplot library and most of the part for Data Prepration has been done already on the datasets.
I have Used Scikit-Learn, Numpy, MatplotLib, Pandas and Jupyter IDE for the whole process.

Thankyou
